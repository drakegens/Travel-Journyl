# Travel-Journyl
This app is for users who want to record and view their travel experiences. The user can also view and add travel related facts from
a prepopulated database. The app also pulls from a BBC RSS feed in order to give users worldwide news for their travels.

### This is an Android App that I created for my Mobile Computing course during my study abroad experience at Glasgow Caledonian University.
